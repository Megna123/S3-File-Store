Project Introduction:
    Application provide the file storage of the customers on S3 bucket.Initially I have a login screen which allow users to login and validate the user based  on the password. I have a signup button which allows user to signup.All the login validations are done through cognito.
	Once the login is successful, the user can see the table of files which lists all the customer file safely in the s3 bucket. I have used one table on Dynamo DB to manage the user activitiies and his profile.
The dashboard even provides the operations to the customer inorder to manage  the files and keeps updated with the file information.
The application has  an admin login which lists all the files providing al the management activities.Application even provides facebook login setup.
